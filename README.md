> 🔗 **Live Web Application:** [https://bahikhata123.netlify.app/](https://bahikhata123.netlify.app/)

## 📌 Project Overview

**Bahi Khata** (*Hindi for Account Ledger Book*) is a full-stack multi-tenant SaaS platform built to digitize daily operations for local businesses and service providers in India — including Kirana/retail shops, milk & water delivery routes, newspaper vendors, daily service providers (cooks, maids, laundries), and their customers.

It simplifies business management by replacing paper registers with:
- **Smart Point of Sale (POS) Billing** with barcode scanning and auto-stock updates.
- **Unique Phone Auto-Lookup** for customer credit (*Udhar*) tracking.
- **Daily Route & Delivery Attendance Tracking** (*Delivered / Skipped*).
- **Automated Subscription Billing** based on actual delivered quantities.
- **Unified Customer Portal** with a one-click **"Pay All"** dues feature.
- **Instant PDF Invoice & Receipt Generation**.

## 🗄️ Database Schema Overview

The database uses PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys (`gen_random_uuid()`):

- `roles`: Pre-seeded user roles (`Customer`, `Retail Shop`, `Delivery Business`, `Service Provider`, `Admin`).
- `users`: Registered users with hashed passwords (`password_hash`), phone, email, and role reference.
- `shops` / `delivery_business` / `service_business`: Business profile details.
- `customers`: Mapping between businesses and customers with live `outstanding_balance`.
- `products` & `inventory`: Catalog management with stock levels and low-stock thresholds.
- `bills` & `bill_items`: POS invoices and line items.
- `payments`: Transaction records.
- `subscriptions` & `subscription_days`: Daily delivery subscriptions and active days.
- `attendance`: Daily delivery tracking (`attendance_date`, `status`, `quantity_delivered`).
- `temp_bills`: Staging table for walk-in customer bills before account registration.
